# SockShop User Tests
This directory contains Kubernetes deployment files from the official [SockShop repository](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo), but with configuration faults injected for the second user test for our Master's Thesis. As such, we do not claim ownership of the Kubernetes deployment files themselves, but we do claim full ownership of the design of the scenarios and the faults we have injected.

The purpose of this user test is to validate the usefulness of our observability pipeline for performance monitoring and optimization of a distributed microservice application. The test participant works through a number of scenarios that each build upon the insight gathered from the previous step. Each scenario represents a bottleneck in the application, which prevents the organization from handling the increased amount of traffic on their cluster. As each bottleneck is resolved, a new bottleneck appears downstream. For each scenario, the application is under a load from 400 concurrent clients, constantly placing orders through the frontend.
